                <p>We work hard to make our site the most comprehensive and helpful inline skating website while also providing the best selection of quality inline skating products you can find online.</p>

                <p>Whether it be our buying guides or our sizing guides - we're always thinking of the best information and content to get everyone out on skates and having a good time.</p>
                <p>Our stores are run by a group of experienced skaters. Most of us come from an aggressive skating background, but over the years we have all developed an increased understanding and appreciation for other styles of skating. Each of our employee's experiences with skating are unique and so is the knowledge they share.</p>
